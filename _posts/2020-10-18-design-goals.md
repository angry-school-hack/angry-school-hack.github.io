# Angry Hack Design Goals
1. Pursue the ideal that no one needs to look up the rules during play. Make rules intuitive and easy to keep in memory.
2. Create a fantasy adventure game system.In this system, players take the role of characters that are highly competent but not dramatically more powerful than the world around them. The characters go on exciting adventures in which they work together to try to solve strange and perilous situations with might and cunning. The characters grow in power, but ultimately are still mortal. (my personal touchstones for this are “The Legend of Zelda”and “Lord of the Rings”). Modules for determining the fate of settlements and playing super-powered demigods could be included.
3. Create a system that promotes the following core gameplay loop:
 a. The group starts out in a relatively safe haven,
 b. The group goes on a journey into dangerous places,
 c. The group explores and fights in order to bring back the necessary things to survive and/or build up their safe haven, and
 d. The group returns to the safe haven. They improve themselves, possibly also building up their town/caravan/settlement in the process, and prepare for their next journey.
4. Encourage the players to look at the situation at least as much as their character sheets.
5. Promote the philosophy that player skill and avatar strength both matter.
6. Create a set of action adjudication tools that help the GM smoothly adjudicate with competence and confidence.
7. Create a set of attributes that define the characters ability to affect the world.
8. Create customization and advancement options for players.
