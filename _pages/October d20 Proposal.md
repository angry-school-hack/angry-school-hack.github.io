title: D20 + Mods Versus Target Number (TN) by October Foundry
permalink: /d201/
---

## The dice mechanic works like this:
1. If the player character’s action can fail, can succeed, and there’s risk or cost, the GM calls for a dice roll.
2. The GM determines how difficult the obstacle is for the average person. The GM then selects the most appropriate Target Number from the tier of difficulties. This is the strength of the obstacle opposing the player character’s action.
3. The GM determines if the PC’s approach is particularly good or bad. If good, the GM lowers the Target Number to the next tier down. If bad, the GM raises the Target Number to the next tier up. If the resulting tier would be below Easy or above Very Hard, stop here. The player character either can’t fail or can’t succeed, and a dice roll is no longer necessary. Otherwise, continue.
4. The GM determines the PC’s most appropriate Attribute. This is the potential the PC brings to bear to resolve the action.
5. The player can suggest an appropriate training the PC has. Alternatively, the GM can suggest an appropriate training. If both agree, the player then adds a bonus for the training.
6. Add or subtract other modifiers if necessary.
7. The player then rolls a d20 and adds the modifiers. If the die result meets or beats the TN, the roll succeeds. If the die result is under the TN, the roll fails.
8. The GM can determine the degree of success or failure by subtracting the TN from the die result.

### Benefits: 
- The mechanic has lots of playtesting
- There is room for characters to increase in power
- Familiar to everyone

### Drawbacks:
- Increased time to read dice results

### Other notes:
- Currently I envision 3 tiers of training: Trained, Expert, and Master. 5e’s Proficiency, half proficiency, and expertise might find a home here. Everybody gets access to Master or expertise eventually.
- Currently fumbles or botches on a natural roll of 1 don’t exist at all.
- Currently criticals on natural 20 rolls might not exist, or might exist only in certain rule modules.
- Degree of success/failure wouldn’t be used for every roll or even most rolls. It would be used for specific purposes, like finding damage results in combat.
- Dice rolls are acting character (whether PC or NPC) vs TN. There are no reactive rolls, such as saves.
- The use of Advantage and Disadvantage are up for consideration.
- The number of TN tiers might be increased or decreased, depending on needs of the system.

| Difficulty | TN |
