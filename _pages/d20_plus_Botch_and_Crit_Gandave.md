title: D20 + Botch + Critical

## Overview
For each task a players rolls a single D20, adds relevant bonuses and compares the result to the target number (TN). The check succeeds if the results matches or exceeds the TN. It may succeed critically on high natural numbers, depending on the character's skill rank, and critically fail, "botch", on low natural numbers, depending on the difficulty of the check and the character's skill rank.

Each character adds the following bonuses to their roll:

- Attribute bonus, ranging from +0 to +6 (default: +2).
- Skill bonus, equal to +0/+2/+4/+6 for untrained, trained, expert, master (default: untrained).
- Item bonus/penalty, equal to -2/+0/+2/+4 for inadequate/average/good/exceptional tools/weapons.
- Circumstance bonus, equal to -4/-2/+0/+2/+4 for terrible/detrimental/average/beneficial/great circumstances.

The TNs are 10/15/20/25/30 for easy/moderate/hard/very hard/impossible tasks.

You may not attempt tasks that exceed your bonus (including circumstances) by 20. You automatically succeed on a task if the TN is equal to your bonus plus one.

## Crits

Depending on their skill rank a player may roll an automatic success even if the check would have failed otherwise. In addition, the check counts as a critical success, if it would have been a regular success in and of itself. A critical success may mean additional progress or damage or a boost in addition to the effects of a regular success. In some situations it may just be a regular success.

| Skill Rank | Bonus | Automatic Success/Critical Success on Natural |
| - | - | - |
| Untrained | +0 | 20 |
| Trained | +2 | 19+ |
| Expert | +4 | 18+ |
| Master | +6 | 17+ |

E.g., an Expert with a +6 bonus will succeed on a natural 18 against a TN of 25, even though his numerical result is 24. On a natural 19 and 20, he scores a critical success.

## Botches

Depending on the difficulty of a check, a player may roll an automatic failure, even if the check would have been successful otherwise. If the check would have been a failure anyway, the check results in a critical failure, a botch. A botch means an additional penalty for failure related to the check. In some situations it may just be a regular failure.

The botch chance is mitigated by one for each skill rank the player has above Untrained.

| Difficulty | TN | Automatic Failure/Botch on Natural |
| - | - | - |
| Easy | 10 | 1 |
| Moderate | 15 | 2- |
| Hard | 20 | 3- |
| Very Hard | 25 | 4- |
| Impossible | 30 | 5- |

E.g., An Untrained person with a +13 bonus attempting a moderate (TN 15) check will fail on a natural 2 and botch on a natural 1. If he were Trained, he would not fail on a natural 2. If he were Expert or Master, he would not botch on a natural 1.

## Possible Progression

At low levels, the PCs will probably start out with attributes ranging from +1 to +3. They will have some skills as *Trained* (+2), and the rest at *Untrained* (+0).

At mid level, the PCs will probably have increased their attribute to be between +2 to +4 and have several skills *Trained* (+2) or are *Experts* (+4).

At high levels, the PCs will have one or two attributes at +6, the rest between +2 and +5. Their specialty skills are mostly *Expert* (+4), though some may be *Mastered* (+6). The rest are a mix of *Trained* (+2) and *Untrained* (+0).

An average starting bonus is +2 for untrained, +4 for trained skills, the maximum bonus with stats alone is +12. Items can increase this to a +16 - but this should be rare.

## Design Considerations

- At its core this is simply the D20 system with expanded chances for crits and botches which are dependant on the skill rank.
- It should give the feeling that most tasks can be attempted by anyone, but are increasingly risky for less trained persons.
- Generally, skill ranks should feel like a big deal, even if the numerically only make up less than half of the final bonus.
- There is additional mental load in determining which natural numbers are crits/botches, but I hope that with little practice, this will happen very fast at the table.
- The gap between low level and high level adventurers may be too high, in which case I'd probably adjust the starting modifiers upwards.
- Alternatively, skill ranks may only give half their bonus (+1/+2/+3), which makes them less valuable numerically, but still very relevant due to crits and botches.
- Personally, I'm always sceptical of botches if they fall into the category "the master swordsman drops their sword for no apparent reason 5% of the time". As botches may occur rather often in this system, they would have to be codified more stringently and be less of a screwjob.
- The system assumes that most actions can be resolved using a skill. For pure attribute based actions, the difficulty has to be set accordingly. It might suffice to leave out the highest two (very hard, impossible).
- As the math for this is quite straight forward, I'll leave out the "Icky Math" section. ;)
