As Angry illustrates in his [latest post](https://theangrygm.com/three-short-stories/), we don’t need too much granularity for action resolution. Primary factors are:
1. **Player's idea.** Good, bad or average.
2. **Character’s talent/skill.** Their avatar strength.

D&D does #1 using Difficulty Class, #2 with ability scores and bonuses. So can we. But I’m not a fan of GM announcing numbers for every roll, so here’s an alternative idea.

Game has 6 Difficulty Classes, similar to D&D. But instead of announcing numbers, GM rolls dice to oppose players. I like this approach, because it lets players *see* the odds of their actions, in a tangible way. The difficulty scale is like this:
* **Very Easy.** d4
* **Easy.** d6
* **Medium.** d8
* **Hard.** d10
* **Very Hard.** d12
* **Impossible.** d20

# Skill Checks
Now, there’s one little hiccup here. This system doesn’t work with Ability Checks. The reason for this is simple: There isn’t enough range in dice sizes. Having 4-5 ability scores on top of skill proficiency bonuses just doesn’t work. Ability scores also limit advancement options, as players will be able to succed on most checks, as soon as they upgrade their ability scores. Skills create a much needed granularity for progression.

So, we focus on Skill Checks. Players have a bunch of skills, and they need to increase them to get better at what they do. It’s that simple. In the beginning, they should have a couple of d8’s, and some d6’s. If they don’t have a skill, they roll a d4.

Let’s say, a player has an Athletics skill of d8. And they are trying to climb an Average Cliff, which is represented by a d8. So both the player and GM roll d8’s and see who wins. If PC wins, they succeed. If GM wins, player fails.

What happens on a tie? Well, PCs might win. Or it might be a partial success.

# Additional Factors: Bonus Die
What about other factors? Such as, equipment or other circumstantial bonuses? Well, we can scale our primary dice up and down, but that gets out of control pretty quickly, as the range is so narrow. So we’ll throw in another die to the mix: Bonus Die. This die isn’t added to the result; instead you pick the higher number of the two.

Bonus Die size depends on how many numerical bonuses you have. The conversion steps can be something like this:

* **+1/2.** d6
* **+3/4/5.** d8
* **+6/7/8/9.** d10
* **+10 and above.** d12

So let’s say, you are still trying to climb that cliff. It’s Athletics d8 vs Average Cliff d8 right? But if you brought a Rope +1, you get to add a d6 to your dice pool. So it’s now d8 and d6 vs d8. You pick the highest of the two, and compare it to the GM’s dice.

# Possibilities for Combat 
What about combat? It is the same deal. You can be either trained in Fighting, or Swords. I suppose this depends on how we design our equipments.

So if you have d8 Fighting and you attack a kobold, whose Defense is d6, the odds are with you. Against a dragon, whose Defense is d12, not so much.

Weapons can be done in a couple of ways. They can give you flat bonuses. Like for instance, Light Weapons might give you +3 to attack (i.e. a second d8 die), but when you hit, you only do 1 damage. Medium Weapons would give you +2, for 2 damage. Heavy Weapons, +1 for 3 damage. Just making up some numbers here, but you get the idea.

Or weapons can be fundamentally different. Like you can be trained in Maces seperately. And all Maces might have a perk that stuns your opponent, when you hit with an Amazing Success. Or something. See below. If you need different combat capabilities, you start learning another weapon.

If we need even more resolution, attacker makes a second roll when they hit, to see if they Damage their opponent. This is done by using their Weapon’s Damage Rating die, vs their opponent’s Toughness. If they succeed, they do some damage.

This second layer can give us additional design options, like weapon die sizes, or different types of attacks. For example you can do a heavy attack, which gives your opponent a Defense bonus; but when you hit, you get a Damage Bonus. Etc.

# Degrees of Success
The numerical difference between PC and GM rolls can give us a Margin of Success. This can be simple. Like, if you beat your opponent’s roll by a margin of 3 (or something), you get an Amazing Success. Which can cause more damage, lets you pick a lock without losing time, forage double amount of food, or whatever. 

Or it can be more granular. The difference itself can be the Margin of Success. This number can be used to generate some more resolution in damage numbers, and maybe other bits.

# Other Situations
Other situations can also create bonuses (even for the GM); such as perks, flanking, light conditions, situational bonus/penalties etc. Penalties would be bonuses to the opposite side.

# Advancement 
Advancement shouldn’t be a problem, as long as we put some skill caps for advancement tiers. With a bunch of skills, players will be able to upgrade their characters pretty often, without breaking the balance of the game. In an assumed 4 Tier advancement system, skill caps should be something like this:

* **T1.** d8
* **T2.** d10
* **T3.** d12
* **T4.** d12+1 (See Bonus Die above)

# Conclusion
I’m not a math head, but my primitive Anydice analyses show me that this system can hold up for some basic gameplay. However, a skill based system being compatible with the Angry Way or not, is an entirely different matter. 

Thank you for reading!
