## What it's for: 
Any roll governing a case not specifically handled by a situation to the contrary in the book.

## What it is: 
Roll a d100, add any relevant bonuses, and compare it to your relevant Rank. If your total is higher than the Rank, the result is a Success.

If you roll doubles (i.e., 11, 44, 99, etc) you may add the sum of your roll's digits (so 2, 8, and 18, respectively, for those examples) to your roll, or to someone else's related roll that takes place immediately after yours. For instance, rolling to pick a door lock and getting doubles allows you to assist an ally's roll to open the door silently afterwards. 

## What it's good at: 
Gradual improvements over time, as PCs' Ranks slowly climb from 90th place (or thereabouts) towards the peak of their skill 

## What setup/elements it requires: 
A set of stats/skills/archetypes/roles/etc 

## What worldfeel it belies: 
A world where people largely stay in one place and have time to experience the consequences of their actions, where hard work and perseverance do bear fruit eventually, where everyone working together truly does achieve more, but where power is relative and competitive
