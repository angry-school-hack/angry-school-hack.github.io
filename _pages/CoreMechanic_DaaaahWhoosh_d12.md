## Details
- Players have bonuses to the roll from 0 to 12:
  - 0 to 4 points for 'talent' (ability bonus)
  - 0 to 4 points for 'skill' (skill bonus)
  - 0 to 4 points for 'tools' (equipment bonus)
    - this section should also be able to cover environmental bonuses (ie advantage/disadvantage)
- assume total bonus will be from 0 to 4/8/12 based on character level
  - **example**: low-level with +2 Strength, +1 Swordsmanship, and +1 Sword, for +4 to attack someone
  - **example**: mid-level with +3 Strength, +3 Swordsmanship, and +2 Sword, for +8 to attack someone
  - **example**: high-level with +4 Strength, +4 Swordsmanship, and a +4 Sword, for +12 to attack
  - **example**: with +0 to the ability, and no relevant skill or tools, you get +0
- GM sets the DC for the check from 8 to 16
  - 3 DCs to choose from in most cases:
    - DC8 for easier tasks
    - DC12 for moderate difficulty
    - DC16 for hard tasks
    - if the player can't win or can't lose, don't ask for a roll
    - probably shouldn't use any higher/lower DCs
      - the dice are only for desperate actions, so don't roll for easy things
      - above 16 the rolls become nigh-impossible, 20 might work at high-level if players expect to fail
- these rolls are made only by the players, never the GM
  - if HP or other resources exist, the GM may need to make other rolls to determine failure costs

## Design Considerations
- this is a simple easy-to-remember system that people who've played D&D will understand
- the numbers are pretty small but with enough room for character advancement
- max roll bonus is equal to the max roll (compared to D&D 5e where it's only about half)
  - this gives more weight to player skill and avatar strength
  - only testing will tell if this will feel empowering or limiting
- for our purposes, the math is pretty simple and well-understood, thus should be easy to develop with
- I tried to stick to D&D's idea that players should succeed 2/3rds of the time
  - the three suggested DCs have roughly 66% chance of success with +4, +8, and +12 bonuses
  - +0 bonus is always going to be unlikely to succeed, as it should be
  - +12 bonus is very likely to succeed, and thus should take effort to build up to
